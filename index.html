            <article>
                <p>My journey at BeCode started only last week, but we learn so many new things everyday...</p>
                <p>So one could really say it was a long time ago.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I learned new things like terminal and Git, and understood better HTML and CSS.</p>
                It was an intense journey, with lots of projects, lots of information, but at the end of the day I feel
                like I really did something.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It's good to be part of such wonderful team!</p>
                <br>
                <p>And the exercises...the exercises were good, but I can say this one really worn me out.</p>
                <p>Anyways, we still go on!</p>
